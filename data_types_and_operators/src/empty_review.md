## Code Review

Certainly, I'd be happy to guide you though the basics of creating a Java-based double linked list.

```java
class Node {
    Node previous;
    Node next;
    int data;
    // Node constructor
    public Node(int data){
        this.data = data;
    }
}

public class DoubleLinkedList{
    Node head; // the head or root of the linked list

    // Insert method for adding data at the start of the list
    public void insertAtStart(int data){
        Node node = new Node(data);
        if (this.head == null){
            this.head = node;
            return;
        }
        node.next = this.head;
        this.head.previous = node;
        this.head = node;
    }
    // other functions like delete and traverse will be similar to above
}
```

This code will help you initialize your linked list and insert at the head, but you will still need to complete other routines such as ```InsertAny``,```Delete```, regarding displaying excepteval operations, and possible sorting (depends on your actual requirement). Make sure to walk through each logic step by step and strengthen your understanding of doubly linked list -- it will be the foundation to your success here!
